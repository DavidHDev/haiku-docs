## What is this?

you time by offering a large collection of `hooks` & `utilities` that will
help you get the job done faster & more efficiently!

## Install

Installing Haiku is very easy! <br />
*Requires React >=16.8.0*

#### NPM
```sh
npm install react-haiku
```

#### Yarn
```sh
yarn add react-haiku
```
#### PNPM
```sh
pnpm install react-haiku
```
<br />


## Using Haiku with NextJS

Because Haiku uses ES6 modules, it is not transpiled by NextJS automatically since it's an external dependency, so you may have to follow a few extra steps to set it up correctly:

1. Add the `next-transpile-modules` package to your project:<br/>

```sh
npm install next-transpile-modules
```

2. Configure your project's `next.config.js` file to transpile Haiku:

```js
const withTM = require('next-transpile-modules')(['react-haiku']);
module.exports = withTM({});
```

After following these two steps, importing features from `react-haiku` into your project should work as expected! <br/><br/><br/><hr />
